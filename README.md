Python code to allow for evaluation of a .csv file of behavioral data acquired from ABET II software based on user input. Code filters data based on number of times the test subject selects the "large reward" during free choice trials. Filtering behavioral data in this manner is the first step in enabling alignment of behavior with calcium channel activity in the brain. By paring these data, we gain the ability of matching local field potenitals of neuronal activity with behavioral manifestations of said activity.
